# Redis-inspired key/value store written in PicoLisp

This program mimics functionality of a [Redis](https://redis.io) in-memory database, but is designed specifically for [PicoLisp](https://picolisp.com) applications without on-disk persistence.

The included `server.l` and `client.l` can be used to send and receive _"Redis-like"_ commands over TCP or UNIX named pipess.

# Requirements

  * PicoLisp 32-bit/64-bit `v17.12` to `v20.6.22`
  * Linux or UNIX-like OS (with support for named pipes)

# Getting Started

This library is written in pure PicoLisp and contains **no external dependencies**.

To ensure everything works on your system, run the tests first: `make check`

### Using the CLI tools

  1. Launch a server with: `./server.l --pass <yourpass> --verbose`
  2. Check the server info with: `./client.l --pass <yourpass> INFO`

That should return some interesting info about your server. See below for more examples.

### Using as a library

**Server**

  1. Load the library in your project: `(load "libkv.l")`
  2. Set the server password: `(setq *KV_pass "yourpass")`
  3. Start listening for requests: `(kv-listen)`

**Client**

  1. Load the client library in your project: `(load "libkvclient.l")`
  2. Set the server password `(setq *KV_pass "yourpass")`
  3. Start the client listener with `(kv-start-client)`
  4. Send your command and arguments with `(kv-send-data '("INFO" "server"))`

Received data will be returned as-is (list, integer, string, etc). Wrap the result like: `(kv-print Result)` to send the output to `STDOUT`:

```
: (load "libkvclient.l")
-> kv-start-client
: (setq *KV_pass "yourpass")
-> "yourpass"
: (kv-start-client)         
-> T
: (kv-send-data '("set" "mykey" 12345))
-> "OK"
: (kv-send-data '("get" "mykey"))      
-> 12345
: (kv-send-data '("set" "yourkey" "12345"))
-> "OK"
: (kv-send-data '("get" "yourkey"))        
-> "12345"
```

Feel free to observe the example code in [client.l](client.l).

> **Note**: Using `(kv-send-data)` will send the data to the server and automatically block the client while waiting for a response.

# Usage

This section describes usage information for the CLI tools `server.l` and `client.l`.

## Server

The server listens in the foreground for TCP connections on port `6378` by default. Only the `password`, `port`, and `verbosity` are configurable, and a `password` is required:

```
# server.l
Usage:                    ./server.l --pass <pass> [options]

Example:                  ./server.l --pass foobared --port 6378 --verbose'

Options:
--help                    Show this help message and exit

--pass <password>         Password used by clients to access the server (required)
--port <port>             TCP listen port for communication with clients (default: 6378)
--verbose                 Verbose flag (default: False)
```

### Examples

```
./server.l --pass yourpass --verbose
Parent PID: 38867
[sibling]=38874
[child]=38873 [parent]=38867
[msg] from client: (pid: 38873) ::ffff:127.0.0.1 ("IDENT" ("id" . "3F21CC32") ("hostname" . "meta.lan"))
[msg] from child : (pid: 38873) ("message" 38873 ("IDENT" ("id" . "3F21CC32") ("hostname" . "meta.lan")))
[msg]   to client: "OK 3F21CC32"
[msg] from client: (pid: 38873) ::ffff:127.0.0.1 ("INFO" "server")
[msg] from child : (pid: 38873) ("message" 38873 ("INFO" "server"))
[msg]   to client: "^J# Server^Japp_version:0.11.0^Jos:Linux 4.19.34-tinycore64 x86_64^Jarch_bits:64^Jprocess_id:38874^Jtcp_port:6378^Juptime_in_seconds:1^Juptime_in_days:0^Jexecutable:/usr/bin/picolisp^J"
[child]=38873 exiting
[msg] from child : (pid: 38873) ("done" 38873 NIL)
```

## Client

The client handles authentication, identification, and sending of _"Redis-like"_ commands to the server. It then prints the result to `STDOUT` and can be parsed by standard _*NIX_ tools. The client receives _PLIO_ data over a TCP socket, or named pipe (if client/server are on the same system).

```
# client.l
Usage:                    ./client.l --pass <pass> COMMAND [arguments]

Example:                  ./client.l --pass foobared --port 6378 INFO server'

Options:
--help                    Show this help message and exit

--id <id>                 Uniquely identifiable client ID (default: randomly generated)
--host  <host>            Hostname or IP of the key/value server (default: localhost)
--pass  <data>            Password used to access the server (required)
--poll  <seconds>         Number of seconds for polling the key/value server (default: don't poll)
--port  <port>            TCP port of the key/value server (default: 6378)

COMMAND LIST              Commands are case-insensitive and don't always require arguments.
                                  Examples:

  DEL key [key ..]                DEL key1 key2 key3
  GET key                         GET key1
  INFO [section]                  INFO memory
  LINDEX key index                LINDEX mylist 0
  LLEN key                        LLEN mylist
  LOLWUT number                   LOLWUT 5
  LPOP key                        LPOP mylist
  LPOPRPUSH source destination    LPOPRPUSH mylist myotherlist
  RPUSH key element [element ..]  RPUSH mylist task1 task2 task3
  SET key value                   SET mykey hello
```

The `COMMANDS` take the exact same arguments as their respective [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands).

# Notes and limitations

This section will explain some important technical details about the code, and limitations on what this library can and can't do.

## Technical notes

  * All keys are stored under the prefix `*KV/`, example: `*KV/mykeys`. This prefix is hardcoded everywhere and shouldn't be changed.
  * Requests and commands generate statistics which are stored in memory (and lost when the server exits). Statistics are stored under the `*KV/%stats%/` prefix and are _read-only_ by external clients.
  * Similar to the [WebSockets protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.3), a unique UUID: `7672FDB2-4D29-4F10-BA7C-8EAD0E29626E` is used during the handshake sequence between all clients and servers. For compatibility with future tools, please do not change it.
  * Passwords are hashed using a very simple and collision-prone hashing function. It is not cryptographically secure or used for that purpose. If using this library over a public network, please use [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) or [hitch](https://github.com/varnish/hitch) as a TLS proxy between the client and server.
  * Output from the `client.l` uses `(prinl)`, so a result `"2"` and `2` will both appear the same. Lists are concatenated with a `,` comma and also output using `(prinl)`. Error messages are sent to `STDERR` and the client exits with error code `1`.
  * Named pipes are created in the `(tmp)` directory of the server's parent process, and will be removed when the parent **exits cleanly**. Please do not kill the parent process with `kill -9` (or `kill -KILL`) as it will leave an unresponsive zombie sibling with the TCP socket still open, and the named pipes will not be removed.
  * A best effort has been made to return the same datatypes and response types as _Redis_. Example: the `SET` command returns `OK` if the key was set. Not all responses are absolutely identical to _Redis_ though. Please remember this library isn't designed to be a perfect clone of _Redis_ (see Limitations below).

## Limitations

  * This library is not used in production and has not been tested extensively (despite all the unit/integration tests). Please use at your own risk.
  * This library **DOES NOT** use the [RESP protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol) and thus cannot work with the `redis-cli` or other _Redis_ clients.
  * Since PicoLisp is not _event-based_, each new TCP connection spawns a new process, which limits concurrency to the host's available resources.
  * Not all [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands) are implemented, because I didn't have an immediate need for them. There are plans to slowly add new commands as the need arises.
  * Using the `client.l` on the command-line, all values are stored as strings. Please use the TCP socket or named pipe directly to store integers and lists.
  * Unlike _Redis_, there is no on-disk persistence and **all keys will be lost** when the server is restarted. This library was originally designed to be used as a temporary FIFO queue, with no need to persist the data. Support for persistence can be added eventually, and I'm open to pull-requests.

# How it works

For the server, everything starts with the `(kv-listen)` function, which is where the TCP server is started:

```text
+------------+   +---------------------+    +----------------+
| TCP client |   | (parent)            |    | (sibling)      |
+-----+---+--+   |    +-------------+  |    | +------------+ |
      ^   |      |    | TCP server  |  |    | | Key/Value  | |
      |   +---------> | (kv-listen) |  |    | | in-memory  | |
      |          |    +-------------+  |    | |     DB     | |
      |          |                     |    | +------------+ |
+-----+-------------> pipe_sibling +------> |                |
|                |                     |    +-+-+-+----------+
|  +--------+    |                     |      | | |
+--+ child1 | <-----+ pipe_child_1 <----------+ | |
|  +--------+    |                     |        | |
|                |                     |        | |
|  +--------+    |                     |        | |
+--+ child2 | <-----+ pipe_child_2 <------------+ |
|  +--------+    |                     |          |
|                |                     |          |
|  +--------+    |                     |          |
+--+ child3 | <-----+ pipe_child_3 <--------------+
   +--------+    |                     |
                 +---------------------+
```

Once `(kv-listen)` is running, a TCP socket is opened on the configured port. An infinite loop begins and listens for incoming connections, giving each new TCP client its own forked child process for handling the request.

A named pipe called `pipe_sibling`, is created in a temporary directory of the top-level **parent** process. This pipe will be used to communicate with other **child** processes, leaving the parent process to continue serving new TCP requests.

The parent process then forks another process, which we'll call the **sibling** - an older sister if you prefer - and the sibling waits on the `pipe_sibling` named pipe, listening for _COMMANDS_ from the child processes.

The forked child processes will each create their own named pipe, called `pipe_child_<pid>`, also in a temporary directory of the top-level **parent** process. The child process will listen on its own named pipe for messages sent by its older sister, the **sibling**. Once a message is received by the child, the response is sent back to the **client** over the TCP connection.

The idea is to have the **sibling** be the holder of all the **keys**. Every _"Redis-like"_ command will have their data and statistics stored in the memory of the **sibling** process, and the **sibling** will handle receiving and sending its memory contents (keys/values) through named pipes to the respective **child** processes.
