## APPEND

#### APPEND key value

If key already exists and is a string, this command appends the value at the end of the string.

#### Return values

  * **Integer**: the length of the string after the append operation
  * **NIL**: if key is not a string or does not exist

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass EXISTS mykey
0
./client.l --pass yourpass SET mykey "Hello"
OK
./client.l --pass yourpass APPEND mykey " World"
11
./client.l --pass yourpass GET mykey
Hello World
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("EXISTS" "mykey"))
-> 0
: (kv-send-data '("SET" "mykey" "Hello"))
-> "OK"
: (kv-send-data '("APPEND" "mykey" " World"))
-> 11
: (kv-send-data '("GET" "mykey"))
-> "Hello World"
: (kv-send-data '("APPEND" "doesntexist" "test"))
-> NIL
```

## BGSAVE

#### BGSAVE

Save the DB in background.

The KV server forks, the parent continues to serve the clients, the child saves the DB
on disk then exits.

An error is returned if there is already a background save running or if there is another non-background-save process running.

#### Return values

  * **String**: `Background saving started` if the `BGSAVE` started correctly or `Error: DB is locked for writing` if the DB is locked.

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass BGSAVE
Background saving started
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("BGSAVE"))
-> "Background saving started"
```
## CLIENT ID

#### CLIENT ID

The command just returns the ID of the current connection. Every connection ID has certain guarantees:

  1. It is never repeated, so if `CLIENT ID` returns the same number, the caller can be sure that the underlying client did not disconnect and reconnect the connection, but it is still the same connection.
  2. The ID is monotonically incremental. If the ID of a connection is greater than the ID of another connection, it is guaranteed that the second connection was established with the server at a later time.

#### Return values

  * **Integer**: The id of the client.

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass CLIENT ID
1
./client.l --pass yourpass CLIENT ID
2
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("CLIENT" "ID"))
-> 3
```

## CLIENT KILL ID

#### CLIENT ID id [id ..]

The command allows to end one or more client connections by their unique `ID` field.

#### Return values

  * **String**: the number of clients connections ended.

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass CLIENT KILL ID 2
1
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("CLIENT" "KILL" "ID" "2"))
-> 0
```

## CLIENT LIST

#### CLIENT LIST

Returns information and statistics about the client connections server in a mostly human readable format.

The KV server forks, the parent continues to serve the clients, the child saves the DB
on disk then exits.

An error is returned if there is already a background save running or if there is another non-background-save process running.

#### Return values

  * **Multi-line String**: a unique string, formatted as follows:
    * One client connection per line (separated by `\n` newline/linefeed)
    * Each line is composed of a succession of `property=value` fields separated by a space character.

Here is the meaning of the fields:

* `id`: an unique auto-incrementing 64-bit client ID
* `pid`: process ID of the forked child handling the request
* `name`: name set by the client, with `--name` or autogenerated
* `addr`: address of the client
* `port`: source port of the client
* `fd`: file descriptor corresponding to the socket

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass CLIENT LIST
id=1 pid=16929 name=4AF35825 addr=::1 port=49774 fd=7
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("CLIENT" "LIST"))
-> "id=2 pid=10019 name=79738D13 addr=::1 port=50956 fd=7"
```

## CONVERT

#### CONVERT

Convert a plaintext database to binary or vice-versa.

The KV server by default saves data on disk in plaintext format, which can be modified by hand by anyone with practically no PicoLisp knowledge. The disadvantage with plaintext is its on-disk footprint is quite large compared to binary. For small datasets the difference is negligible, but it could also affect performance when first loading the database.

While the server is running, it is possible to dump the database to disk using a different format, for example: if it's currently saving in plaintext, `CONVERT` will dump it to disk in binary. All future saves will also be in binary until the server is restarted, or until another `CONVERT` command is sent (which would convert it back to plaintext).

Using the CLI tool:

  * The default filename for binary format is `kv.bin`.
  * The default filename for plaintext format is `kv.db`.

Using the PicoLisp library:

The database filename can be changed through the `*KV_db` variable, example `(setq *KV_db "/path/to/db.bin")`

  * To enable `binary` saving in PicoLisp, use `(on *KV_binary)`
  * To disable `binary` saving in PicoLisp, use `(off *KV_binary)`

#### Return values

  * **String**: `OK` if the database was converted successfully.

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass CONVERT
OK
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("CONVERT"))
-> "OK"
```

## DEL

#### DEL key [key ..]

Removes the specified keys. All given keys are removed whether they exist or not.

#### Return values

  * **Integer**: The number of keys that were removed.

#### CLI example

```bash
./client.l --pass yourpass SET key1 "Hello"
OK
./client.l --pass yourpass SET key2 "World"
OK
./client.l --pass yourpass DEL key1 key2 key3
3
```

#### PicoLisp example

```picolisp
: (kv-send-data '("SET" "key1" "Hello"))
-> "OK"
: (kv-send-data '("SET" "key2" "World"))
-> "OK"
: (kv-send-data '("DEL" "key1" "key2" "key3"))
-> 3
```
